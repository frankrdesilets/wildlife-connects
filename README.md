Wildlife Connects is a full-stack web portal that was developed for [Texas Wildlife Association](https://www.texas-wildlife.org) during a spring 2025 internship with FreeLikeYou, a company founded by a Southwestern University alumnus. I designed and implemented the platform in its entirety.

It is the intellectual property of FreeLikeYou and as such code cannot be shared. Rather, this document aims to showcase the impact and high-level details of the project.

*Note: All screenshots in this document were approved by FreeLikeYou to share. They were taken from a local development environment with fake accounts and information. Screenshots are located at the [bottom](#newsletter) of the document.*

## Description

The application automated and replaced Texas Wildlife Association's existing manual, email-based "Adult Learn to Hunt" application system, and streamlined workflows for over 800 members applying to hunts as well as for administrators reviewing and managing applications and supporting documents by providing an intuitive, centralized platform.

The portal is both internal and external. User accounts have member functionality (apply to hunts, upload documents, etc.) and admin accounts have administrative abilities (manage land profiles and hunts, manage hunt applications, manage users and documents, etc.) in addition to normal member functionality. The only difference between a user and admin account is the dashboard, as users have a member dashboard and admins have an administrative dashboard (as such, all administrative controls are located in the admin dashboard). The rest of the platform is identical for both users and admins.

## Technology

### Back-end

Laravel was used as the backend PHP framework due to its expansive feature set, which includes MVC architecture, routing, robust security including authentication, Eloquent ORM, database migrations, and validation.

### Front-end

Bootstrap was used at the front-end HTML and CSS framework. Use was made of the grid system to ensure accessibility across a range of devices.

### Database

MySQL was used as the database management system. It was interacted with primarily through Laravelâ€™s Eloquent ORM.

### Cloud

Laravel Cloud was used as the infrastructure and deployment platform due to its exclusive support and optimization for Laravel applications.

Google Cloud Platform was used for a Google Drive API integration, facilitating cloud storage of user documents.
